### A Sawayama Solitaire clone written in Odin and Raylib

This is my first game! 

Its just a clone of one of the solitaire games from Zachtonics [Last Call BBS](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1511780/Last_Call_BBS).

Theres still a lot of TODOS here to make it a full fledge game. I have to finish the winning states. And also include things like
a title screen/etc. This was mostly a fun project just to learn Odin and Raylib.
